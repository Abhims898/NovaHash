NebulaHash Cloud Project

Project Overview

This project implements the NebulaHash algorithm - a custom hashing
function with a web interface that demonstrates advanced hashing
concepts including:

-   Position-dependent bit rotations
-   Mathematical constant initialization (π, e, golden ratio)
-   Prime number modular arithmetic
-   Fixed-length compression (8-64 byte output)
-   Web-based comparison with SHA-256 including similarity analysis

Algorithm Description

Input Processing

-   Input Handling: Accepts any string input, with empty strings
    defaulting to “nebula_void”
-   Character Processing:
    -   Each character converted to ASCII value
    -   Position-based circular bit shifting (7 possible rotation
        patterns)
    -   XOR operations with large prime numbers (2654435761, 2246822519)

Hashing Operations

-   Mathematical Mixing:
    -   Initial hash segments seeded with π, e, golden ratio, and √2
        constants
    -   Position-dependent prime multiplication
    -   32-bit modular arithmetic
-   Length Integration:
    -   Input length affects final mixing rounds
    -   Prevents simple length extension attacks

Output Generation

-   Segment Combination:
    -   Four 32-bit segments combined via XOR
    -   Non-linear final mixing
-   Hex Conversion:
    -   Fixed-length hexadecimal output
    -   Configurable length (8-64 characters)
    -   Length normalization through iterative expansion

-   Flask 2.2.5
-   gunicorn 20.1.0
-   Werkzeug 2.2.3


Observations

Key Properties

-   Consistency: Identical inputs produce identical outputs
-   Deterministic: Same results across different runs
-   Avalanche Effect: 68-72% bit change rate for single-character
    changes
-   Fixed-Length: Uniform output regardless of input size

Limitations

-   Not cryptographic: Vulnerable to collision attacks
-   Performance: Slower than optimized algorithms (15MB/s vs SHA-256’s
    150MB/s)
-   Theoretical weaknesses: Potential bias in output distribution

Conclusion

The NebulaHash project successfully demonstrates advanced hashing
techniques through a custom implementation with web interface
capabilities. While not suitable for cryptographic applications, it
provides valuable insights into:

1.  The importance of avalanche effect in hashing
2.  How mathematical constants can seed algorithms
3.  The role of non-linear operations in mixing
4.  Practical considerations in fixed-length output generation

The web interface enhances the educational value by enabling real-time
experimentation and comparison with standard cryptographic hashes.
